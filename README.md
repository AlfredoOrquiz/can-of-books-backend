# Project Name

**Authors**: Carlos A. Herrera, Alfredo Orquiz
**Version**: 1.0.0

## Overview
<!-- Provide a high level overview of what this application is and why you are building it, beyond the fact that it's an assignment for this class. (i.e. What's your problem domain?) -->
Books are life-changing. They have the power to enlighten, educate, entertain, heal, and help us grow. Build out this code base to create an web app to track what books have impacted you, and what's recommended to read next.

## Getting Started
<!-- What are the steps that a user must take in order to build this app on their own machine and get it running? -->

## Architecture
<!-- Provide a detailed description of the application design. What technologies (languages, libraries, etc) you're using, and any other relevant design information. -->

## Change Log
<!-- Use this area to document the iterative changes made to your application as each feature is successfully implemented. Use time stamps. Here's an example:

01-01-2001 4:59pm - Application now has a fully-functional express server, with a GET route for the location resource. -->

29-AUG-22 1443 - proof of life established for server
30-AUG-22 1400 - added book descriptions

## Estimates

Name of feature: Building CRUD apps with MongoDB

Estimate of time needed to complete: 6 hours

Start time: 1400

Finish time: 1600 the next day

Actual time needed to complete: about 6 hours

## Credit and Collaborations

### Logistical

* What hours will you be available to communicate?

    from 9am-9pm

* What platform will you use to communicate (ie. Slack, phone …)?

    slack and email

* How often will you take breaks?

    every 45min-1hr

* What is your plan if you start to fall behind?

    ask for help from TAs, Sheyna, and classmates

### Cooperative

* Make a list of each person’s strengths.

    My strengths: persistence, conceptual understanding of JS

    Alfredo's strengths: collaboration, UI styling with CSS

* How can you best utilize these strengths in the development of your application?

    We will be a driven and dedicated team that strives to build a functional JS platform with Node.js and mongoose, and styled to accessibility standards with CSS.

* In what areas do you each want to develop greater strength?

    I would like to develop greater technical skills writing and troubleshooting code, and Alfredo would like to build on his JS knowledge.

* Knowing that every person in your team needs to understand the code, how do you plan to approach the day-to-day development?

    We will hold periodic stand-up style meetings starting with a morning review of the Trello board and a mid-day review to discuss deadlines.

### Conflict Resolution

* What will your team do if one person is pulling all the weight while the other person is not contributing?

    Set expectations early and have a one-on-one discussion.

* What will your team do if one person is taking over the project and not letting the other member contribute?

    I will ask them to be more open with their process and discuss the importance of collaboration. I let my teammates know to expect the same from me.

* How will you approach each other and the challenge of building an application knowing that it is impossible for two people to be at the exact same place in understanding and skill level?

    We are at similar levels, but in general, I try to not be defensive and ask my teammates to explain their thought process when I don't understand.
